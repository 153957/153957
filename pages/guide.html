                    <h3>Basics of Time-lapse</h3>

                    <h4>Definition</h4>

                    <p>Time-lapse: Denoting the photographic technique of
                    taking a sequence of frames at set intervals to record
                    changes that take place slowly over time. When the frames
                    are shown at normal speed, or in quick succession, the
                    action seems much faster.</p>

                    <p>So, what exactly does this mean and how do we achieve
                    this <em>Time-lapse</em> effect? You'll need a camera and a
                    subject that changes over time, like a sunset or flowers.
                    Then simply need to take photos at a different speed then
                    at which you will play them back.</p>

                    <h4>Example</h4>

                    <p>Take a total of 100 photos, taking one photo every 10
                    seconds<br>
                    <strong>100 photos x 10 seconds = 1000 seconds</strong><br>
                    Make a movie playing at 25 fps from these photos, the movie
                    will be 4 seconds long<br>
                    <strong>100 photos / 25 frames per second = 4
                    seconds</strong><br>
                    This movie will speed up time by a factor of 250<br>
                    <strong>1000 seconds / 4 seconds = 250x</strong></p>

                    <p>So if a flower normaly takes half an hour to open, you
                    can show that flower opening with a movie 8 seconds long if
                    you take one photo every 10 seconds and play it back at 25
                    frames per second<br>
                    <strong>2000 seconds / 250 = 8 seconds</strong></p>

                    <p>Using this basic knowledge, you can take the photos at a
                    shorter or longer interval and play them back faster or
                    slower to achieve different effects, it is advised to
                    choose the playback speed in such a way that the motion of
                    the movie is smooth, not to fast nor to slow. You can make
                    a Time-lapse movie from just about anything, just let your
                    imagination take control.</p>

                    <h3>Requirements</h3>

                    <h4>Recording - the camera</h4>

                    <p>For this you can use a digital or analog device. Digital
                    is preferable as that will make the following steps much
                    easier. The device can be a still camera, video camera,
                    webcam or something equivalent.</p>

                    <p>A very important requirement is that you can control the
                    interval at which the device takes pictures (see Trigger,
                    below). It also needs to have enough storage to be able to
                    hold all the pictures that you want for your Time-lapse,
                    they can either be stored on the camera or the computer.
                    The camera of course needs a good battery, or you need to
                    use an AC adapter to give it continuous power.</p>

                    <h4>Trigger - an intervalometer</h4>

                    <p>If your camera doesn't support interval shooting on its
                    own; use a computer or an intervalometer to trigger the
                    camera instead. See the topic 'Taking the pictures' for a
                    list of useful software and possible intervalometers.</p>

                    <p>A computer will need to be connected to the camera via
                    an USB cable, and make sure that the camera is set to the
                    correct USB mode (PTP/MTP) to allow the computer to control
                    it. A laptop might be most useful because it is very
                    flexible, and can be taken to places where a desktop
                    computer can not. You do have to make sure that your laptop
                    battery will last long enough.</p>

                    <h4>Stability - a tripod</h4>

                    <p>A tripod is very important when making a Time-lapse
                    movie. It will ensure that all pictures are aligned
                    correctly. Sometimes it can be useful to weigh down your
                    tripod with extra weight to lower the center of gravity and
                    increase stability.</p>

                    <p>If you don't have a tripod, you can use a flat and
                    steady surface instead. Make sure that your camera is
                    stable by slightly 'pushing' it around and seeing if it
                    moves or remains stable.</p>

                    <h4>Composition - a subject</h4>

                    <p>Of course you also need something to make the pictures
                    of, preferably something that moves. Try to predict how the
                    subjet will move over time to make certain that your camera
                    covers the correct angle and uses the correct interval to
                    show the motion.</p>

                    <p>Possible subjects:<br>
                    <em>Clouds, flowers, ice, clockwork, people, animals,
                    traffic, sunrise, sunset and stars.</em></p>

                    <h3>Taking the pictures</h3>

                    <p><a href=
                    "http://www.dpreview.com/products/search/cameras#criterias=SpecsCoreParams%2CSpecsTimelapseRecording&amp;paramSpecsTimelapseRecording=Yes">
                    Some cameras</a> have a built-in intervalometer which allow
                    you to take Time-lapse photos without an external device.
                    If your camera doesnt have this option (or if are using a
                    webcam) you need a computer with the right software or an
                    intervalometer to take control over the camera.</p>

                    <p>Depending on your software/hardware/subject you must
                    select an interval (e.g. 5 seconds) between each photo and
                    the total amount (e.g. 500) of photos to be made. Then
                    initiate the shooting and wait while your photos are being
                    taken. Then tranfer them to your computer (if you where
                    using the computer to make the photos, the photos most
                    likely will already be transfered to the computer). After
                    this you can make a movie out of them.</p>

                    <h4>Power</h4>

                    <p>If you do use a battery, make sure that it is fully
                    charged. If you intend to make a long Time-lapse or if you
                    are shooting via the computer I suggest you use an AC
                    adapter for the camera: to keep it powered for an unlimited
                    time. I almost always use an AC adapter when shooting
                    Time-lapse, it is more reliable then a battery. Moreover,
                    some AC adapters allow the battery to remain in the camera
                    so it will act as backup should the power fail.</p>

                    <h4>Storage</h4>

                    <p>Check that you have enough space left on your memory
                    card to fit all the images that you want to take. If you
                    don't have enough storage you might consider setting your
                    camera to a lower quality setting (not recommended). Or
                    just buy a larger memory card, since memory cards are
                    fairly cheap these days you can easily buy an 8GB+ memory
                    card which can hold many photos. I recommend shooting in
                    the highest quality possible. This gives you the most
                    flexibility when you process the images.</p>

                    <h4>Exposure mode</h4>

                    <p>Usually you should put your camera in Manual mode (a
                    fixed aperture and exposure time), because that will
                    prevent a lot of flickering in the resulting movie. Make
                    sure that you take some test shots before starting the
                    Time-lapse to make sure the exposure is set correctly.</p>

                    <p>When lighting conditions are very inconsistent, it may
                    be beter to let the camera determine the shutter speed, you
                    should then use Aperture priority mode (fixed aperture) to
                    prevent changing of Depth of Field, while letting the
                    camera decide the appropriate exposure. If there is still
                    flickering in your movie, see the Advanced section on ways
                    of fixing this.</p>

                    <p>You should not use Auto White balance, set the camera to
                    a specific white balance preset to keep it constant
                    throughout the movie. This is especially important if you
                    shoot JPG, since that makes it more difficult to adjust it
                    later.</p>

                    <h4>Manual focus</h4>

                    <p>If your camera supports manual focus and your subject
                    will remain at approximately the same distance; use manual
                    focus. If you use auto focus your camera might fail to
                    focus correctly on some shots, which does not look pretty
                    in the final movie. Using manual focus will also increase
                    your camera's battery life.</p>

                    <h4>Computer controlled</h4>

                    <p>When using a computer to control your camera make sure
                    that the camera's USB mode is correctly set. Most cameras
                    can be set to either 'Mass Storage' or 'PTP' (or 'MTP'), to
                    control it via a computer the camera has to be set to PTP
                    (or MTP) mode.</p>

                    <h4>Intervalometers</h4>

                    <p>There is a lot of software and hardware available to
                    control cameras for Time-lapse shooting, here are some
                    examples:</p>

                    <h3>How to make movies out of pictures</h3>

                    <p>Once you have made the photos for your Time-lapse movie
                    you will want to make a movie out of them, here are some
                    tips to help you do that.</p>

                    <h4>Tip; First frame</h4>

                    <p>If you have to press a button on your camera to start
                    the Time-lapse shooting I suggest you do this:<br>
                    Often when you press the botton on your camera, to make the
                    first photo, you move the camera a little bit, this causes
                    the first photo to be a bit off center when compared to the
                    photos, therefore I suggest you remove the first photo
                    before you make the movie.</p>

                    <h4>Software</h4>

                    <p>There is a lot of software that can help you to make a
                    movie from your images. Some are free, some are not, some
                    are better then others, some offer more options then
                    others... I suggest you take a look at all of them and see
                    which best fits with your needs.</p><br>

                    <h4>Exporting the movie</h4>

                    <p>My general export settings:<br>
                    Export movie: <strong>QuickTime Movie</strong><br>
                    Video codec: <strong><a href=
                    "http://www003.upp.so-net.ne.jp/mycometg3/" target=
                    "_blank">x264Encoder</a></strong><br>
                    Data rate: <strong>±1500 kbits/sec</strong><br>
                    Image size: <strong>(Fit within) 640x640</strong></p>

                    <p>The size and data rate are such that it fits well on my
                    website and loads fairly quickly for almost everyone, yet
                    maintains high quality. Besides these basic settings I also
                    export my movies into a couple other formats (webm, ogv,
                    iphone compatible h264), to make sure that everyone with a
                    modern browser can view them.</p>

                    <h4>Walkthroughs for QuickTime and After Effects</h4>

                    <p>Here are two methods to make movies with <a href=
                    "http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/" target=
                    "_blank">Apple QuickTime Player 7</a> (<strong>not</strong>
                    QuickTime X). One with the <a href=
                    "http://www.apple.com/quicktime/pro/" target="_blank">Pro
                    ($30)</a> version and one with the free version. If you use
                    Snow Leopard or Lion read <a href=
                    "http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3678" target=
                    "_blank">this</a> to get QuickTime Player 7. There are also
                    some basics for using Adobe After Effects to assemble a
                    movie.</p>

                    <p>I will assume that all frames for your movie are in one
                    folder and in correct alphabetical order. Some programs
                    require the frames to be named sequentially (without gaps),
                    this can be a problem if you removed some (bad) frames. A
                    program to batch rename program can easily fix this; I
                    personally use <a href=

                    <h4>Preventing flicker</h4>

                    <p>If you have made your Time-lapse movie on a cloudy day
                    or with a lightbulb, the lighting conditions may have
                    changed a lot during the shoot. This might cause
                    flickering, brightness differences between consecutive
                    frames, in your movie. A lightbulb can cause flickering
                    because of the way AC power outlets works, namely at
                    50-60Hz. This causes slight fluctuations in the brightness
                    of the bulb, our eyes usually don't see this because they
                    work at ~25Hz. Therefore you will need to set your camera
                    to shutterspeeds slower then 1/25th of a second, preferably
                    slower to make sure that one exposure encompasses multiple
                    periods of fluctuations of your lightbulb, thus evening out
                    the light changes.</p>

                    <p>Another cause of flicker in Time-lapse is
                    'Aperture-flicker'. This refers to the effect that the
                    aperture of the lens does not close precisely the same
                    amount for every photo. This means that slightly more or
                    slightly less light will enter the camera, while the
                    shutter speed remains the same. Here is <a href=
                    "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG5QedhroYQ" target=
                    "_blank">a video</a> that shows how the aperture blades
                    move during the taking of a photo. There are several ways
                    to avoid this potential problem, you can for instance shoot
                    'wide-open' (lowest f-stop), because then the aperture does
                    not move at all. There are also ways to fix the aperture of
                    a lens to a certain setting on a DSLR, by partly loosening
                    the lens from the camera body in a particualar way, but
                    that is more complicated.</p>

                    <h4>Removing flicker</h4>

                    <p>Luckily there is software out there that can help in
                    post-processing to remove flicker. For instance, for
                    Windows, there are a couple free deflicker plug-ins for
                    <a href="http://www.virtualdub.org/" target=
                    "_blank">VirtualDub</a> (free), namely <a href=
                    "http://compression.ru/video/deflicker/index_en.html"
                    target="_blank">MSU Deflicker</a> and <a href=
                    "http://neuron2.net/deflick/flick.html" target=
                    "_blank">Graft Deflicker</a>. Another free plug-in, made
                    for Adobe Lightroom, is <a href="http://lrtimelapse.com/"
                    target="_blank">LrTimelapse</a>. There is more software
                    that can help remove flicker, but not all are free, one of
                    such is <a href=
                    "http://www.granitebaysoftware.com/Products/ProductGBD.aspx"
                    target="_blank">GBDeflicker</a> ($80) this is a plug-in for
                    Adobe After Effects and is available for both Mac OS and
                    Windows.</p><br>

                    <h4>Ramping Exposure</h4>

                    <p>This is an extremely useful technique for sunset or
                    sunrise Time-lapses, since during such an event the proper
                    exposure for the scene changes dramatically. If you dont
                    change the exposure of the camera accordingly, the photos
                    will either turn black or white really fast. Ramping
                    (changing over time) the exposure counters this by changing
                    the exposure such to compensate for the changing light
                    levels. When done properly it can also prevent
                    flickering.</p>

                    <p>One method of ramping is often referred to as Bulb
                    ramping. Devices like the <a href=
                    "http://www.thewhippersnapper.com/LittleBramper/" target=
                    "_blank">Little Bramper</a> control the camera exposure
                    time during a Time-lapse. This requires you to turn your
                    shutter speed to bulb mode, then the Bramper will control
                    the exposure time (and the intervals) of the camera, which
                    can be programmed to change over time.</p>

                    <p>Other methods are to slowly change the aperture of the
                    lens or the ISO in the camera, or even to use combinations
                    of changing the aperture/shutter speed/ISO.</p><br>

                    <h4>Motion (more info soon)</h4>

                    <p>There are several ways to get (camera) motion in a
                    Time-lapse movie. First of you you can let your camera move
                    slowly while you are shooting. Secondly you can add motion
                    to the movie after you have shot it, by using video editing
                    software.</p>

                    <h4>Motion during shoot</h4>

                    <p>You can use a <a href=
                    "http://shop.telescope-warehouse.com/product.sc?productId=119&amp;categoryId=1"
                    target="_blank">Milapse head</a> ($195) combined with the
                    <a href="http://openmoco.org/" target="_blank">Open
                    Moco</a> timeismotion software to add pan and tilt to your
                    Time-lapse movies. The software and tripodhead are designed
                    specifically for motion in Time-lapse, being able to move
                    very slowly and create natural looking motion (ease-in and
                    out).</p>

                    <h4>Motion in post</h4>

                    <p>Another option is to use software like Adobe After
                    Effects to create a fake motion. You can add two keyframes
                    to your movie in After Effects, one where the motion starts
                    and one where it should end. Each with a different
                    position/scale for the movie, the program will then
                    automatically create the motion (with ease-in and out if
                    you want) to go from one situation to the other, thus
                    simulating motion.</p>
