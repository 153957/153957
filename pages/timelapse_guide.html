    <h3 id="basics">Basics of Time-lapse</h3>

    <h4>Definition</h4>

    <p>
        Time-lapse: Denoting the photographic technique of taking a sequence of frames at
        set intervals to record changes that take place slowly over time. When the frames
        are shown at normal speed, or in quick succession, the action seems much faster.
    </p>

    <p>
        So, what exactly does this mean and how do we achieve this <em>Time-lapse</em>
        effect? You'll need a camera and a subject that changes over time, like a sunset
        or flowers. Then simply need to take photos at a different speed then at which you
        will play them back.
    </p>

    <h4>Example</h4>

    <p>
        Take a total of 100 photos, taking one photo every 10 seconds:<br>
        <strong>100 photos × 10 seconds = 1000 seconds</strong>.<br>
        Make a movie playing at 25 fps from these photos, the movie will be 4 seconds long:<br>
        <strong>100 photos / 25 frames per second = 4 seconds</strong>.<br>
        This movie will speed up time by a factor of 250:<br>
        <strong>1000 seconds / 4 seconds = 250×</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        So if a flower normaly takes half an hour to open, you can show that flower
        opening with a movie 8 seconds long if you take one photo every 10 seconds and
        play it back at 25 frames per second<br>
        <strong>2000 seconds / 250 = 8 seconds</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Using this basic knowledge, you can take the photos at a shorter or longer
        interval and play them back faster or slower to achieve different effects, it is
        advised to choose the playback speed in such a way that the motion of the movie is
        smooth, not to fast nor to slow. You can make a time-lapse movie from just about
        anything, just let your imagination take control.
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>


    <h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>

    <h4>Recording - the camera</h4>

    <p>
        For this you can use a digital or analog device. Digital is preferable as that
        will make the following steps much easier. The device can be a still camera, video
        camera, webcam or something equivalent.
    </p>

    <p>
        A very important requirement is that you can control the interval at which the
        device takes pictures (see Trigger, below). It also needs to have enough storage
        to be able to hold all the pictures that you want for your time-lapse, they can
        either be stored on the camera or the computer. The camera of course needs a good
        battery, or you need to use an AC adapter to give it continuous power.
    </p>

    <h4>Trigger - an intervalometer</h4>

    <p>
        If your camera doesn't support interval shooting on its own; use a computer or an
        intervalometer to trigger the camera instead. See the topic 'Taking the pictures'
        for a list of useful software and possible intervalometers.
    </p>

    <p>
        A computer will need to be connected to the camera via an USB cable, and make sure
        that the camera is set to the correct USB mode (PTP/MTP) to allow the computer to
        control it. A laptop might be most useful because it is very flexible, and can be
        taken to places where a desktop computer can not. You do have to make sure that
        your laptop battery will last long enough.
    </p>

    <h4>Stability - a tripod</h4>

    <p>
        A tripod is very important when making a time-lapse movie. It will ensure that all
        pictures are aligned correctly. Sometimes it can be useful to weigh down your
        tripod with extra weight to lower the center of gravity and increase stability.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you don't have a tripod, you can use a flat and steady surface instead. Make
        sure that your camera is stable by slightly 'pushing' it around and seeing if it
        moves or remains stable.
    </p>

        {% include "guide_screenshot.html" with section='require' image='superclamp_rail' caption='Clamped to rail' %}
    </div>

    <h4>Composition - a subject</h4>

    <p>
        Of course you also need something to make the pictures of, preferably something
        that moves. Try to predict how the subjet will move over time to make certain that
        your camera covers the correct angle and uses the correct interval to show the
        motion.
    </p>

    <p>
        Example subjects:<br>
        <em>Moving clouds, blooming or withering flowers, melting ice, clockwork, people, animals, traffic,
        sunrise, sunset, and stars.</em>
    </p>


    <h3 id="taking">Taking the pictures</h3>

    <p>
        Some cameras have a built-in intervalometer which allow you to take time-lapse
        photos without an external device. If your camera doesnt have this option (or if
        are using a webcam) you need a computer with the right software or an
        intervalometer to take control over the camera.
    </p>

    <p>
        Depending on your software/hardware/subject you must select an interval (e.g. 5
        seconds) between each photo and the total amount (e.g. 500) of photos to be made.
        Then initiate the shooting and wait while your photos are being taken. Then
        tranfer them to your computer (if you where using the computer to make the photos,
        the photos most likely will already be transfered to the computer). After this you
        can make a movie out of them.
    </p>

    <h4>Power</h4>

    <p>
        If you do use a battery, make sure that it is fully charged. If you intend to make
        a long time-lapse or if you are shooting via the computer I suggest you use an AC
        adapter for the camera: to keep it powered for an unlimited time. I almost always
        use an AC adapter when shooting time-lapse, it is more reliable then a battery.
        Moreover, some AC adapters allow the battery to remain in the camera so it will
        act as backup should the power fail.
    </p>

    <h4>Storage</h4>

    <p>
        Check that you have enough space left on your memory card to fit all the images
        that you want to take. If you don't have enough storage you might consider setting
        your camera to a lower quality setting (not recommended). Or just buy a larger
        memory card, since memory cards are fairly cheap these days you can easily buy an
        8GB+ memory card which can hold many photos. I recommend shooting in the highest
        quality possible. This gives you the most flexibility when you process the images.
    </p>

    <h4>Exposure mode</h4>

    <p>
        Usually you should put your camera in Manual mode (a fixed aperture and exposure
        time), because that will prevent a lot of flickering in the resulting movie. Make
        sure that you take some test shots before starting the time-lapse to make sure the
        exposure is set correctly.
    </p>

    <p>
        When lighting conditions are very inconsistent, it may be beter to let the camera
        determine the shutter speed, you should then use Aperture priority mode (fixed
        aperture) to prevent changing of Depth of Field, while letting the camera decide
        the appropriate exposure. If there is still flickering in your movie, see the
        Advanced section on ways of fixing this.
    </p>

    <p>
        You should not use Auto White balance, set the camera to a specific white balance
        preset to keep it constant throughout the movie. This is especially important if
        you shoot JPG, since that makes it more difficult to adjust it later.
    </p>

    <h4>Manual focus</h4>

    <p>
        If your camera supports manual focus and your subject will remain at approximately
        the same distance; use manual focus. If you use auto focus your camera might fail
        to focus correctly on some shots, which does not look pretty in the final movie.
        Using manual focus will also increase your camera's battery life.
    </p>

    <h4>Computer controlled</h4>

    <p>
        When using a computer to control your camera make sure that the camera's USB mode
        is correctly set. Most cameras can be set to either 'Mass Storage' or 'PTP' (or
        'MTP'), to control it via a computer the camera has to be set to PTP (or MTP) mode.

    <h3 id="making">How to make movies out of pictures</h3>

    <p>
        Once you have made the photos for your time-lapse movie you will want to make a
        movie out of them, here are some tips to help you do that.
    </p>

    <h4>Tip; Remove the first frame</h4>

    <p>
        If you have to press a button on your camera to start the time-lapse shooting I
        suggest you do this:<br> When you press a button on your camera to initiate the
        time-lapse, you are moving the camera a little bit. This causes the first photo to
        be a bit off center when compared to the other photos. Therefore I suggest you remove
        the first photo before you make the movie.
    </p>

    <h4>Software</h4>

    <p>
        There is a lot of software that can help you to make a movie from your images.
        Some are free, some are not, some are better then others, some offer more options
        then others. I suggest you take a look at all of them and see which best fits
        with your needs.

    <h4>Exporting the movie</h4>

    <p>
        My general export settings:<br>
        Export movie: <strong>QuickTime Movie</strong><br>
        Video codec: <strong><a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.264" target="_blank">x264</a></strong><br>
        Data rate: <strong>±1500 kbits/sec</strong><br>
        Image size: <strong>(Fit within) 640x640</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        The size and data rate are such that it fits well on my website and loads fairly
        quickly for almost everyone, yet maintains high quality. All modern browsers can view these
        H.264 encoded videos.
    </p>

    <h4>Walkthrough for Adobe After Effects</h4>

    <p>
        Here is a method to make movies from the individual frames I will assume that all
        frames for your movie are in one folder and in correct alphabetical order. Some
        programs require the frames to be named sequentially (without gaps), this can be a
        problem if you removed some (bad) frames. A program to batch rename program can
        easily fix this; I personally use
        <a href="http://www.publicspace.net/ABetterFinderRename/" target="_blank">A Better Finder Rename</a>.
    </p>

    <h5>Steps</h5>

    <ul>
        <li>Go to File → Import → File... (or use cmd+I on a Mac)</li>
        <li>Navigate to the folder containing the image sequence, select all images, check the checkbox to
            import the image as a <strong>sequence</strong>, then choose Open</li>
        <li>If the images are in RAW format you will be shown a RAW settings window to tweak your images</li>
        <li>The new movie appears in the Project panel of After Effects, this is the image sequence that you just imported</li>
        <li>Drag this movie either to the timeline at the bottom or into the Composition area</li>
        <li>Now you can add effects by dragging them from the Effects panel onto the composition</li>
        <li>You can also add panning, zooming and other transformation effects to your movie, by using keyframes</li>
        <li>When you are done editing there are several ways in which you can export the movie:
            <ul>
                <li>File → Export → MPEG-4 and use the same settings that I use to export from QuickTime.</li>
                <li>Composition → Make Movie, this will add the movie to the Render Queue where you can choose
                    render settings and then export the movie</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="flicker">Preventing flicker</h3>

    <p>
        If you have made your time-lapse movie on a cloudy day or if the scene is lit by a
        lightbulb, the lighting conditions may have changed during the shoot. This might
        cause flickering in your movie, brightness differences between consecutive frames.
        A lightbulb can cause flickering because of the way AC power outlets works,
        namely at 50-60Hz. This causes slight fluctuations in the brightness of the bulb,
        our eyes usually don't see this because they work at ~25Hz. Therefore you will
        need to set your camera shutter speed slower than 1/25th of a second, preferably
        slower to make sure that one exposure encompasses multiple periods of fluctuations
        of your lightbulb, thus evening out the light changes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another cause of flicker in time-lapse is 'Aperture-flicker'. This refers to the
        effect that the aperture of the lens does not close precisely the same amount for
        every photo. This means that slightly more or slightly less light will enter the
        camera, while the shutter speed remains the same. Here is <a href=
        "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG5QedhroYQ" target= "_blank">a video</a> that
        shows how the aperture blades move during the taking of a photo. There are several
        ways to avoid this potential problem, you can for instance shoot 'wide-open'
        (lowest f-stop), because then the aperture does not move at all. There are also
        ways to fix the aperture of a lens to a certain setting on a DSLR, by partly
        loosening the lens from the camera body in a particualar way, but that is more complicated.
    </p>

    <h4>Removing flicker</h4>

    <p>
        Luckily there is software out there that can help in post-processing to remove
        flicker. For Adobe Lightroom, a plug-in can be used: <a
        href="http://lrtimelapse.com/" target="_blank">LrTimelapse</a>. There is more
        software that can help remove flicker, but not all are free, one of such is <a
        href= "http://www.granitebaysoftware.com/Products/ProductGBD.aspx"
        target="_blank">GBDeflicker</a> ($80) this is a plug-in for Adobe After Effects
        and is available for both Mac OS and Windows.

    <h4>Ramping Exposure</h4>

    <p>
        This is an extremely useful technique for sunset or sunrise time-lapses, since
        during such an event the proper exposure for the scene changes dramatically. If
        you dont change the exposure of the camera accordingly, the photos will either
        turn black or white really fast. Ramping (changing over time) the exposure
        counters this by changing the exposure such to compensate for the changing light
        levels. When done properly it can also prevent flickering.
    </p>

    <p>
        One method of ramping is often referred to as Bulb ramping. Devices exist which
        control the camera exposure time during a time-lapse. This requires you to turn
        your shutter speed to bulb mode, then the device will control the exposure time
        (and the intervals) of the camera, which can be programmed to change over time.
    </p>

    <p>
        Other methods are to slowly change the aperture of the lens or the ISO in the
        camera, or even to use combinations of changing the aperture, shutter speed, and ISO.

    <h3 id="motion">Motion</h3>

    <p>
        There are several ways to get (camera) motion in a time-lapse movie. First of you
        you can let your camera move slowly while you are shooting. Secondly you can add
        motion to the movie after you have shot it, by using video editing software.
    </p>

    <h4>Motion during shoot</h4>

    <p>
        You can use a <a href="http://www.dynamicperception.com/default.asp"
        target="_blank">Dynamic Perception</a> setup combined with the <a
        href="https://github.com/DynamicPerception/OMLibraries" target="_blank">Open
        Moco</a> software to add pan and tilt to your time-lapse movies. The software and
        tools are designed specifically for motion in time-lapse, being able to move very
        slowly and create natural looking motion (ease-in and out).
    </p>

    <h4>Motion in post</h4>

    <p>
        Another option is to use software like Adobe After Effects to create a fake
        motion. You can add two keyframes to your movie in After Effects, one where the
        motion starts and one where it should end. Each with a different position/scale
        for the movie, the program will then automatically create the motion (with ease-in
        and out if you want) to go from one situation to the other, thus simulating motion.
